Handling GPX data using PowerShell

There is surprisingly little on the web about manipulating GPX data with PowerShell. The initial commit here shows a trivial example of how to extract data from a .gpx file into a PowerShell object.

Clone the repository then
```
cd GPXwithPowershell
./readgpx1.ps1
```

The output should be as in the file readgpx1-output.txt

If you have PowerShell installed in linux, the example works there if you are at a PowerShell prompt.
